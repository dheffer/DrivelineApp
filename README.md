# **Vehicle Management System & Marketplace**
#### A vehicle management system & marketplace for our Capstone Project in the Winter 2024 semester. Our app allows users to buy, sell, or rent vehicles. Users have a 'garage' to manage their vehicles, which allows them to view all the vehicles in their possession along with details about them.

## Description:
> The goal of this application will be to provide users with a marketplace for buying, selling, and renting vehicles. 
> It will contain user & vehicle profiles, with a ‘My Garage’ section for users to track their vehicles. The application will cater to individual vehicle owners and businesses alike.
> To foster transparency and informed decision making, vehicles listed for rent or sale will contain a variety of information about the vehicle, such as its current condition, details of any accidents or collisions, as well as a log of maintenance history.
